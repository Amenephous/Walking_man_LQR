# Walking Man Simulation with LQR Controller

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating the walking motion of a humanoid robot using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller based on principles similar to those of an inverted pendulum.

## Files

1. **lqr_simulation.m**: MATLAB script that implements the LQR control algorithm to compute optimal control gains for the walking simulation.

2. **WalkingManSimulation.m**: MATLAB function for animating the walking motion of the humanoid robot based on the computed LQR control gains and principles similar to those of an inverted pendulum.
